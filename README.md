Pjoect Finished: Ongoing

# Project Note:
This project reflects a larger private Repository, while the code here represents a smaller portion of the full picture (2% of the music data and approximately 10% of the overall code), it captures the overall structure and purpose of the private work. This public repository demonstrates the core functionality, while maintaining the confidentiality of the broader project.
(Lofi is one of 5 music genres in the originally repository including: Productivity, Dark Synthwave, Synthwave x2)
 
## Project Description:
- Leveraged Python to implement advanced data processing techniques, extracting unstructured data from YouTube
video descriptions and transforming into structured Pandas Data frames.
- Developed robust CSV file handling mechanisms to store and facilitate seamless management of music data.
- Automated the process of extracting random samples from dynamic study playlists, to establish a YouTube channel
focused on curated study playlists across various genres.

## Project Structure:
- music_data: Contains the unstructured music data from YouTube.
- music_functions: Stores the required functions used in creator_csv.py & creator_vid.py
- creator_csv: Creates the csv files with structured data necessary to create the vids.
- ceator_vid: Creates the new randomized unique video tracklists.
